    "# 09 Bag Of Words and N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Bag Of Words**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bag of words is a Natural Language Processing technique of **text modelling**. In technical terms, we can say that it is a method of **feature extraction** with text data. This approach is a simple and flexible way of extracting features from documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A bag of words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. We just keep track of word counts and **disregard the grammatical details and the word order**.\n",
    "-  It is **called a “bag”** of words because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded.\n",
    "- The model is only concerned with whether known words occur in the document, not where in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is the Bag-of-Words algorithm used?**\n",
    "-  The dataset is **messy and unstructured and not fixed-length inputs**, and machine learning algorithms prefer **structured, well defined fixed-length inputs** and by using the Bag-of-Words technique we can convert variable-length texts into a fixed-length vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The machine learning models work with **numerical data** rather than textual data. By using the bag-of-words (BoW) technique, we convert a text into its equivalent **vector of numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: ”The Cat sat here” \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: “The Cat sat in the hat” \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: “The Cat is with the hat”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Convert the above sentences in lower case as the case of the word does not hold any information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Remove special characters and stopwords from the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying the above steps, the sentences are changed to\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: ”the cat sat” \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: “the cat sat in the hat” \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: “the cat with the hat”\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the above sentences do not make much sense the maximum information is contained in these words only.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Go through all the words in the above text and make a list of all of the words in our model vocabulary.\n",
    "- [\"the\", \"cat\", \"sat\",\"in\",\"hat\",\"with\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now as the vocabulary has only 6 words, we can use a fixed-length document-representation of 6, with one position in the vector to score each word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: [1,1,1,0,0,0] \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: [2,1,1,1,1,0] \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: [2,1,0,0,1,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3IACMnNpwVlCl8kSTJocPA.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "- In bag of words we consider all words as same weighted.\n",
    "ex : His brother is good.\n",
    "here GOOD is highly weighted word and brother is less weighted. In Bag of word we consider all words as same weighted.\n",
    "- It disregard the grammatical details and the word order when storing words.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  **CountVectorizer** \n",
    "Used to count the number of words present in a sentence."
